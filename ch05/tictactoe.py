# Chapter 5: Array-Based Sequences: Multidimensional Data Sets

# To properly initialize a two-dimensional list, 
# we must ensure that each cell of the primary list refers to an independent instance of a secondary list. 
# This can be accomplished through the use of Pythonâ€™s list comprehension syntax.
# data=[[0]*c for j in range(r)]
# This command produces a valid configuration, similar to the one shown in Fig- ure 5.24. By using list comprehension, 
# the expression [0]*c is reevaluated for each pass of the embedded for loop. 
# Therefore, we get r distinct secondary lists, as desired. (We note that the variable j in that command is irrelevant; 
# we simply need a for loop that iterates r times.)


# data = [[0] * 3 for _ in range(5)]
# print("\n[[0]*3 for j in range(5)]: \n", data)
