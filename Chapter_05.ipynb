    "any individual byte of memory can be stored or retrieved in $O(1)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, a programming language keeps track of the association between an identifier and the memory address in which the associated value is stored.\n",

    "### 5.2.1 Referential Arrays\n",
    "Python represents a list or tuple instance using an internal storage mechanism of array of object **references**. At the \n",

    "number of bits are used to represent a compact array within a string typically requires 2 bytes. If each character were \n",
    "stored independently as a one-character string, there would be significantly more bytes used. Python\n",

    "\n",
    "Another advantage to a compact structure for high-performance computing is that the primary data are stored consecutively in memory. Note that\n",
    "this is not the case for a referential structure. Because of the workings of the cache and memory hierarchies of computers, it is often\n",
    "advantageous to have data stored in memory near other data that might be used in the same computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the apparent inefficiencies of referential structures, we will generally be content with the convenience of Python's list and tuples in this book.\n",
    "The only place in which we consider alternatives will be in memory management section, which focuses on the impact of memory usage on data structures and algorithms. Python provides several means for creating compact arrays of various types.\n",

    "\n",
    "The strategy of replacing an array with a new, larger aray might at first seem slow, because a single append\n",
    "operation may require $\\Omega(n)$ time to perform, where $n$ is the current number of elements in the array.\n",
    "However, notice that by doubling the capacity during an array replacement, our new array allows us to add $n$ new\n",
    "elements before the array must be replaced again. In this way, there are many simple append operations\n",
    "for each expensive one. This fact allows us to show that performing a series of operations on an initially empty dynamic array is\n",
    "efficient in terms of its total running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an algorithmic design pattern called **amortization**, we can show taht performing a sequence of such append operations\n",
    "on a dynamic array is actually quite efficient.To perform an **amortized analysis**, we use an accounting technique where we \n",
    "view the computer as coin-operated appliance that requires the payment of one **cyber-dollar** for a constant amount of computing time.\n",
    "When an operation is executed, we should have enough cyber-dollars available in our currnet \"bank account\" to pay for that operation's running time.\n",
    "Thus, the total amount of cyber-dollars spent for any computation will be proportional to the total time spent on that computation.\n",
    "The beauty of using this analysis method is that we can overcharge some operations in order to save up cyber-dollars to pay for\n",
    "others. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 5.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $S$ be a sequence implemented by means of a dynamic array with initial capacity one, using the strategy of doubling the array size when full.\n",
    "The total time to perform a series of $n$ append operations in $S$, starting from $S$ being empty, is $O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Justification:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that one cyber-dollar is enough to pay for the execution of each append operation in $S$, excluding the time\n",
    "spent for growing the array. Also, let us assume that growing the array from size $k$ to size $2k$ requires $k$ cyber-dollars for the time\n",
    "spent initializing the new array. We shall charge each append operation three cyber-dollars. Thus, we overcharge each append operation that does not \n",
    "cause an overflow by two cyber-dollars. Think of the two cyber-dollars profited in an insertion that does not grow the array as being \"stored\" with the cell in which the element was inserted.\n",
    "An overflow occurs when the array $S$ has $2^i$ elements, for some integer $i \\geq 0$, and the size of the array used by the array representing $S$ is $2^i$.\n",
    "THus, doubling the size of the array will require $2^i$ cyber-dollars. Fortunately, these cyber-dollars can be \n",
    "found stored in cells $2^{i-1}$ through $2^i -1$. Note that the previous overflow occurred when the number of elements became\n",
    "larger than $2^{i-1}$ for the first time, and thus the cyber-dollars stored in cells $2^{i-1}$ through $2^i-1$ have not yet been spent.\n",
    "Therefore, we have a valid amortization scheme in which each operation is charged three cyber-dollars and all the computation time is paid for.\n",
    "That is, we can pay for the execution of $n$ append operations using $3n$ cyber-dollars. In other words, the amortized running time of each append operation\n",
    "is $O(1)$; hence, the total running time of $n$ append operation is $O(n)$.\n"

    "### Geometric Increase in Capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the proof of Proposition 5.1 relies on the array being doubled each time we exapand, the $O(1)$ amortized bound per operation can be proven for any geometrically increasing progression of array size.\n",
    "When choosing the geometric base, there exists a trade-off between run-time efficiency and memory usage. WIth a base of 2, if the last insertion causes a resize event,\n",
    "the array essentially ends up twice as large as it needs to be. If we instead increases the array by only 25% of its current size, we do not risk wasting as much memory in the end, but there will be more\n",
    "intermediate resize events along the way. The key to the performance is that the amount of additional space is proportional to the current size of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Beware of Arithmetic Progression\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid reserving too much space at once, it might be tempting to implement a dynamic array with a strategy in which a constant number of additional cells are reserved each time an array is resized.\n",
    "Unfortunately, the overall performance of such a strategy is significantly worse. At an extreme, an increase of only one cell causes each append operation to resize the array, leading to a familiar $1 + 2 + \\cdots + n$ summation and \n",
    "$\\Omega(n^2)$ overall cost. Using increases of 2 or 3 at a time is slightly better, but the overall cost remains quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a fixed increment for each resize, and thus an arithmetic progression of intermediate array sizes, results in an overall time that is quadratic in the number of operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Proposition 5.2\n",
    "\n",
    "Performing a series of $n$ append operations on an initially empty dynamic array using a fixed increment with each resize takes $\\Omega(n^2)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A lesson to be learned from Proposition 5.1 and 5.2 is that a subtle difference in an algorithm design can produce drastic differences in the asymptotic performance. and that a careful analysis can provide important insights into the design of a data structrue.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Usage and Shrinking an Array\n",
    "\n",
    "Another consequence of the rule of a geometric increase in capacity when appending to a dynamic array is taht the final array size is guaranteed to be proportional to the overall number of elements.\n",
    "That is, the data structure uses $O(n)$ memory. This is a very desirable property for a data structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a container, such as a Python `list`, provides operations that cause the removal of one or more elements, greater care must be taken to ensure that a dynamic array guarantees $O(n)$ memory usage. THe risk is that\n",
    "repeated insertions may cause the underlying array to grow arbitrarily large, and that there will no longer be a proportional relationship between the actual number of elements and the array capacity after many elements are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "A robust implementation of such a data structure will shrink the underlying array, on occasion, while maintaining the $O(1)$ amortized bound on individual operations.\n",
    "However, care must be taken to ensure that the structure cannot rapidly oscillate between growing and shrinking the underlying array, in which case the amortized bound would not be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    " ### 5.3.3 Python's List Class\n",
    " \n",
    " Python is not using a pure geometric progression, nor is it using an arithmetic progression for `list` class.\n",
    " \n",
    " With that said, it is clear that Python's implementation of the `append` method exhibits amortized constant-time behavior. We can demonstrate this fact experimentally.\n",
    " We can get a more accurate measure of the amortized cost per operation by performing a series of $n$ append operations on an initilaly empty list and determining the *average* cost of each. A function to perform that is given by follow:\n",
