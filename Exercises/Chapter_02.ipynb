However, the syntax `v \u003d [5, 3, 10, -2, 1] + u` is illegal. Explain how the `Vector` class definition can be revised so that this syntax generates a new vector.\n",

        "The `Vector` class of Section 2.3. provides a constructor that takes an integer `d`, and produces a d-dimensional vector with all coordinates equal to 0. Another convenient form for creating a new vector would be to send the constructor a parameter that is some iterable type representing a sequece of numbers, and to create a vector with dimension equal to the length of that sequence and coordinates equal to the sequence values. For example, `Vector([4, 7, 5])` would produce a three-dimensional vector with coordinates `\u003c4, 7, 5\u003e`. Modify the constructor so that either of these form is acceptable; that is, if a single integer is sent, it produces a vector of that dimension with all zeros, but if a sequence of numbers is provided, it produces a vector with coordinates based on that sequence."

        "In Section 2.3.5, we note that our version of the Range class has implicit support for iteration, due to its explicit support of both `__len__` and `__getitem__`. The class also receives implicit support of the Boolean test, `k in r` for Range `r`. This test is evaluated based on a forward iteration through the range, as evidenced by the relative quickness of the test `2 in Range(10000000)` versus `9999999 in Range(10000000)`. Provide a more efficient implementation of the `__contains__` method to determine whether a particular value lies within a given range. The running time of your method should be independent of the length of the range."

Each element of the list should be a `Bear` object, a `Fish` object, or `None`. In each time step, based on a random process, each animal either attempts to move into an adjacent list location or stay where it is. If two animals of the same type are about to collide in the same cell, then they stay where they are, but they create a new instance of that type of animal, which is placed in a random empty (i.e., previously None) location in the list. If a bear and a fish collide, however, then the fish died (i.e., it disappears)."
